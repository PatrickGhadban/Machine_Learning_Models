* Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used to predict the probabilty of categorical data. It is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more non-numerical independent variables
* Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable (i.e. target) is categorical. Examples include:
    * Predicting if a tumor is benign (0) or malignant (1)
    * If an email is not spam (0) or spam (1)

* In this folder, I analyzed the following:
    * Logistic Regression  - Breast Cancer DataSet - Determine if a cancer diagnosis was benign (0) or malignant (1)
    * Multi-Class Logistic Regression - Iris DataSet - Determine if an iris was Setosa (0), Vericolor (1), or Virginica (2)
    * Non-linear Logisitc Regression - Microchip DataSet - Determine if a a microchip was in-valid (0) or valid (1)
