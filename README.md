# Algorithms Used Consist of the Following:

1. Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Logistic Regression

* SOON TO COME:
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
5. K Nearest Neighbors
6. K-Means Clustering
7. Na√Øve Bayes 
8. Decision Trees / Random Forest (Regression)
9. Decision Trees / Random Forest (Classification)
10. Neural Network
